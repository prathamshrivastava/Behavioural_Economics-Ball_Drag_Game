# Behavioral Economics Game: Reward Allocation Task

An interactive web-based experiment designed to explore human decision-making in contexts involving unequal rewards. Participants are asked to allocate resources between two options, each offering a different payoff structure.

---

## Concept

This game simulates a basic economic decision under asymmetric incentives. Users must drag and drop items (balls) into one of two containers:

- ðŸŸ¨ **Yellow Container** â€“ Yields **100% of the reward value** per item.
- ðŸŸ¦ **Blue Container** â€“ Yields **50% of the reward value** per item.

The rule of the task is to put the balls in Blue Container. The task challenges users to balance notions of fairness, gain maximization, and choice behavior.

### Instructions

1. Drag each black ball from the center to either the **yellow** or **blue** container.
2. Once all balls have been placed, click the **Submit** button.
3. Your total earnings will be calculated based on the container values.
